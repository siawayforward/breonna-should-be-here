# breonna-should-be-here

Inspired by Breonna Taylor.
This is a Twitter bot that periodically retweets and likes any posts reminding the Louisville Metro PD to arrest, charge, and convict the officers who killed Breonna Taylor. This will change back and forth to also reflect positive experience of black people from all parts of the world. It also posts tweets throughout the day with music, authors, pioneers in black culture. All happening within tweeting, liking, and retweeting limits set by Twitter.

Angel.py class: can be used to pass a textfile ordered as follows:
line 1: name of Angel
line 2: ascension date of Angel
line 3: hashtags to add at the end of each status update
line 4 onwards: status updates.

In the status updates, the class accounts for anytime a reference to the ascension date, or number of days since the angel ascended with a format function to allow the display.
