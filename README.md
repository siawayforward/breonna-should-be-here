# breonna-should-be-here
A Twitter bot that periodically retweets and likes any posts reminding the Louisville Metro PD to arrest, charge, and convict the officers who killed Breonna Taylor. This will change back and forth to also reflect
positive experience of black people from all parts of the world. It also posts tweets throughout the day. All happening within tweeting, liking, and retweeting limits.
